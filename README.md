Fourier optics is a branch of the physics based specifically in the Fourier Transform, it is of important applicability in signal processing of periodic phenomena in optics, However, it fails to find a value of the frequency for a function f(x) in a time estimated.

V. Namias in 1980 proposed a new transform (equation 1) called Fractional Fourier Transform [2], which has been of increasing interest for the scientific community because of several interesting properties [3, 4]; in particular, it has been found very useful for the representation of functions, this has arisen many special implementations for the signal processing [5, 6, 8].
